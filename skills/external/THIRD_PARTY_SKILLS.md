# Third-Party Skills

This repository follows a conservative licensing split:

- Keep authored skill content in `skills/custom/`.
- Reference external skills by source URL and install command.
- Do not vendor third-party skill text unless license, attribution, and redistribution terms are explicit.

See [SKILLS_MANIFEST.md](SKILLS_MANIFEST.md) for current references.
