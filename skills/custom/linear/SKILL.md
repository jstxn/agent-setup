# Linear

## Workflow

1. Clarify goal and scope (team/project, issue(s), labels, dates).
2. Read first (list/search/get) to gather context.
3. Apply create/update operations in grouped batches.
4. Summarize completed changes and remaining blockers.

## Guardrails

- Confirm identifiers before mutation.
- Explain bulk grouping logic before applying updates.
