# Workspace Beta Overlay (Template)

Use this for a web product workspace.

## Rules

1. Prefer strict typing and explicit runtime validation.
2. Preserve accessibility and responsive behavior.
3. Keep UI behavior changes covered by unit/e2e tests where feasible.
4. Keep public APIs and schema contracts synchronized across call sites.
