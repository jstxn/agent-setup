# Agent Setup (Obfuscated Workflow Example)

This repository is a sanitized, markdown-only example of a real agentic coding workflow setup.

Goal: show how the workflow is actually structured in practice, while removing private names and sensitive path details.

## What This Mirrors

- Global policy: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- Workflow orchestration: [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)
- Claude policy: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md)
- Codex policy: [.codex/AGENTS.md](.codex/AGENTS.md)
- Claude subagents: [.claude/agents](.claude/agents)
- Commonly used Codex skills: [.codex/skills](.codex/skills)

## Repository Characteristics

- Markdown-only (every tracked file is `.md`)
- Obfuscated identifiers and workspace names
- Copy-first: intended for people to adapt sections/files into their own setup

## Obfuscation Notes

Some names are intentionally replaced with placeholders such as:

- `workspace-alpha`
- `workspace-beta`
- `/Users/<user>/...`

The structure and workflow behavior are kept close to the original setup.
