# Workspace Gamma Overlay (Template)

Use this for infrastructure and automation workspaces.

## Rules

1. Reproducibility first: deterministic scripts and version pinning where practical.
2. Changes must include rollback notes in docs or PR description.
3. Avoid force operations unless explicitly justified.
4. Validate scripts in dry-run mode before apply mode.
