## Residual Risks

- Validation was targeted to the five previously reported findings and their affected files.
- Full-repo review may still identify unrelated low-priority documentation improvements.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. Keep skill docs and bundled assets synchronized when copying between real dotfiles and this markdown-only mirror.
2. Keep `.codex/AGENTS.md` in sync with root `AGENTS.md` whenever Obsidian or knowledge-capture policy changes.
3. Re-run a full-repo review after the next policy update batch.
