# Contributing

## Scope

This repository is documentation-only and markdown-only.

## Rules

- Keep all tracked files as `.md`.
- Preserve the workflow structure and intent of the mirrored setup.
- Keep private identifiers obfuscated (workspace names, user-specific paths, org/project names).
- Do not add secrets, credentials, internal URLs, or private operational data.

## Validation (Manual)

1. Confirm only markdown files are tracked.
2. Review changes for private-name/path leakage.
3. Ensure links between markdown files resolve.
